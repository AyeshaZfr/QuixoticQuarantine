Project Name: Quixotic Quarantine

Project Description: The project is about advertising a film called Quixotic Quarantine. The user can view the trailer, make bookings, read reviews and meet the cast/crew behind the production.

Process: I initially made wireframes for every page. these were very helpful in giving me an idea about the basic structure of the webpages when writing the html/css for the pages. One thing I would do differently next time is that I would make a basic structure consisting of boxes before I go on to add images and text into my website; for this project I started of by adding one element at a time and this approach lead to a lot of hassle and  everything ended up being all over the place instead of being organized into a structure. 


Reflection/Evaluation: My expectations from this project were to familiarize myself with html and CSS and to get a good grip of them before I go on to take more demanding projects. My expectations have been met and I am more comfortable than before when using html and CSS. Learning, however, is a continuous process and I know that every project will add new skills and demand more attention than the previous. Nonetheless, I am excited for what the other projects have in store for me. Through this project I also dicovered numerous websites that host a plethora of resources to help us implement a certain animaton/ idea we have.
