Project Name: Quixotic Quarantine

Project Description: The project is about advertising a film called Quixotic Quarantine. The user can view the trailer, make bookings, read reviews and meet the cast/crew behind the production.

Process: I initially made wireframes for every page. these were very helpful in giving me an idea about the basic structure of the webpages when writing the html/css for the pages. One thing I would do differently next time is that I would make a basic structure consisting of boxes before I go on to add images and text into my website; for this project I started of by adding one element at a time and this approach lead to a lot of hassle and  everything ended up being all over the place instead of being organized into a structure. 


Reflection/Evaluation: My expectations from this project were to familiarize myself with html and CSS and to get a good grip of them before I go on to take more demanding projects. My expectations have been met and I am more comfortable than before when using html and CSS. Learning, however, is a continuous process and I know that every project will add new skills and demand more attention than the previous. Nonetheless, I am excited for what the other projects have in store for me. Through this project I also discovered numerous websites that host a plethora of resources to help us implement a certain animaton/ idea we have. 


# Assignment#2 Comix Strip

### Project Name: Comic Strip

### Project Description:
This project aims to narrate a story with a centeral concept of "unpredictability". the story revolves around a single character who has to make multiple choices throughout the day and all these choices eventually lead to an eventual outcome. overall the user makes 4 choices and there is one chance choice where the user flips a dice and a random outcome is chose. We aimed to convey a storyline that focuses on the unpredictability of life choices and perhaps we have achieved this through our implementation of the concept.

### Process: 
The color scheme generally implemented is grayscale; this amplifies the notion of unpredictability and mystery. the only colors that show on the screen are for the options the user has to select, this not only highlights the options but also gves the user a sense of control over the general grayscale theme of the website. furhtermore, there are controls that allow the user to replay the comic once it ends and navigate between pages after clicking an option. The navigations alongs with the volume controls give the user  a great sense of control over the webiste so the comic strip does not seem to be a one way authorative strip; they allow the user to be involved within the conversation in the comic. We employed eextensive javaScript to implement the navigation between different comics, replay, to allow the user to mute/unmute and make choices. Animations were also employed to ensure that the choices seem well defined and clear. The website is here -> hasin-shabbir.github.io/comicStrip.

Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
from this project i expected and hoped to learn more about java script and its implementation as well as to work on the shortcomings of my previous website. Through the multiple elemts pertinent to user interactivity,  I was able to learn alot about javascript and its implementation.  Furthermore, we added alot of elements into the website that were not part of the wireframe yet having the wireframe made it so much easier to proceed with the development of the website.
